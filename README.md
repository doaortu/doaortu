### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal gpt extension (private currently), screenshooter app for linux (private currently).
- ðŸ”­ I'm also contributing on a few opensource projects, including [githib cli](https://github.com/cli/cli), [open-sauced/insights](https://github.com/open-sauced/insights), [open-sauced/browser-extensions](https://github.com/open-sauced/browser-extensions), and I'm planning on contributing to gopls, vscode some time later.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI technologies, Golang, Nextjs, Astro, Chrome Extensions, and planning on to learn IOT when I got the devices.
